react redux setup:

1: we install the 2 pacgages we need 
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit,npm install react-redux,

2.then we create file named state and add main store called store.js
and another file slices where we add all the slices for the store


3.we create the store this way:
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { exampleSlice} from "./Slices/exampleSlice";

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    example: exampleSlice.reducer
  },
});

4.then we create the slice like this:
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import productsData from "../../data/products.json";

export const ProductsSlice = createSlice({
  name: "example",
  initialState: {
    example: we can put arrays,numbers everything,
  },
in reducers we add all the functions we need to work with states,
reducers use state and actions, the state is the value of what 
we need to change and we can call ite like state.example to change
the value of the state and we use actions to define the payload
witch will be add where the function will be called like this :
addToCard(selectedProduct)
  reducers: {
	 addToCart: (state, action) => {
             const { selectedProduct } = action.payload;
             const product = state.products.find((product) => product.id === selectedProduct.id);
             if (product) {
             product.inCart = true;
         },

export const { addToCart} = ProductsSlice.actions;
export default ProductsSlice.reducer;

5.so if we need to get a value out of the slice we can useSelect like this:
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
const products = useSelector(state => state.products.products);

6. if we need to use function we use dispatch and apply it like this:
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { addToCart } from "../../state/Slices/ProductsSlice";

const dispatch = useDispatch();

we add it like these where we need to use it 
dispatch(addToCart(here is action.payload));
