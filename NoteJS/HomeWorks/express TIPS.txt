For the server to work with routes you need 4thinks

1. index.js or the main router here you have all info port host database connect and dont forget to
connect to global router

2.example.model.js or the file where all operations and logic is done, here you have joi validation
the constructor of how will it look and all the logic as save,getbyID,create,update,hashPasswords

3.example.controller.js or the file where you handle req,res, here you have try/catch and handle
all the logic from modal.js 

4.example.routes.js or the endpoints, here you connect it with controller and you can put middlewears
here for ex:roleValidator, and put how to call you endpoints

tips:
-use jwt tokens for auth
-awlays hash password
-awlays use database
-the tokens are add in controller


JPW tokens simple guide:
1.Create functions for create and verify with special code
2.after you sing the tokens with special code,in the controller add it with that function
3.Then you add it in header and connect it with server
4.Create special endpoint for refresh tokens to create new access tokens every set time
5.tokens also have payload you can add stuff like id,role becouse you can use tokens on more servers
